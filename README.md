# Q-learning based Maze Solver
A maze solver application that makes use of the Q-learning algorithm

## Overview
This application/project was developed as a part of the graduate course "Intelligent Systems", which is part of the Intelligent Embedded Systems Master's degree program offered by Mälardalen University, Sweden.

</p>
In addition to implementing the standard Q-learning algorithm, the application also allows for various configurations and heuristics, such as dead-end detection, greedy learning, and learning from fixed or varied initial points.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: A directory containing the main implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm for solving mazes, and a random maze generator
- `mazes/`: A directory where maze files are stored. Each maze file represents a different environment for testing the algorithm.
- `main.py`: Used for testing solutions on different mazes, demonstrating the functionality of the Q-Learning algorithm.
- `ProjectReport.pdf`: The project report
